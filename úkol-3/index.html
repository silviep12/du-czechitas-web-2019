    <h2>Briefly About Me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Silvie Průchová.
    </p>
    <p>
        I live in České Budějovice. I graduated from<strong> South Bohemian University and Charles University in
        Prague.</strong>
        I am qualified both in the field of Science and Languages. However, no university is able to prepare you for the
        ups and downs of <em>parentig</em>, which has been my biggest challenge so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever it's possible we travel as a family. Travelling abroad helps my children to look at the life from a
        different perspective and last but not least helps them understand why learning foreign languages is so
        important.

    <p>Travelling with the kids is not always so easy. Everything is about good planning and timing. The successful
        holiday means they mustn't get bored and must be kept entertained all the time. Ideally you mix physical activity
        with getting to know new things. Thankfully one doesn't have to travel so far to get all this. Austria is a real
        paradise for little explorers like this Triassic Park.  <a href="https://www.triassicpark.at">Enjoy your trip back in time!

    <h2>How To Contact Me</h2>
    <p>
        You won't find my profile on social networks neither the profile of my family or most of my friends. We live our
        lives, we don't watch them.
        However, if you want a link on this "web page" then here's a link to
        <a href="https://withoutthebollocks.blogspot.com">my friend's blog.</a>
        She is highly familiar with blogging and all social networks. I can be reached only by
        <a href="mailto:silvie.pruchova@seznam.cz">my email</a>.
